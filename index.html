    <!-- hi hi if youre seeing this that means youre using inspect element to look through my website! im honestly flattered but you should know that a LOT of the code here is not mine. the majority of the formatting here is taken from the ever so popular sadgrl's layout template which you can find at https://sadgrl.online/projects/layout-builder/, which i found from https://rafaelpro3728dos.neocities.org. highly recommend both of them, check them out they are both way more talented than i. with that have fun lookin at this lol-->

                    <p> 
                    <center>hello this website is pretty bigly under development so just be patient lol</center><br><br><center>– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – </center><br><br>
                    <h3>who is this guy<br></h3>
                    hi my name is ben if you couldnt have guessed already i sometimes go by ikupoku now on the internet though i am a chinese freshman here and i am alright at school<br>i really like a lot of different things (you can find all the stuff in the handy dandy sidebar) but the main things are gunpla/gundam, touhou*†, engineering, vocaloid, and oxford commas. you can find me on saturn also<br><br>
                    <h3>the point<br></h3>
                    i made this website just because i wanted an auto changing bio on saturn and couldnt get it because the saturn web app is killed, so the next best thing clearly was to spend a few days learning css and html and stealing and stitching together copious amounts of code from other websites to make this. also like meant to be portfolio kinda and student and blah blah blah<br>
                    actually on the topic of origin stories the name of ikupoku came from a science goformative code in like 6th or 7th grade which read ik2p0k and i thought of iku nagae from touhou because my brain is rotted and is beyond repair (i swear i am not as a degenerate as i read here) and just made it rhyme lol<br>hey if you wanna make some cool websites like this one check out <a href="https://neocities.org/" target=blank>neocities.org</a> its an awesomely accessible introduction to html and css and everything that makes a website a website i know its super intimidating at first but i was pretty much had an anti-knowledge about cs and coding and still got this website pretty cool and functional within a week, its really cool.<br>
                    anyways, thats about it for intros and whatever, check out some of more of what i do if youd like its like 11 right now im thirsty im gonna go to bed now
                    <br><br><span style="font-size: 10px">*the stereotype is real ive never played anything other than lostword and thousand night anamnesis<br></span><span style="font-size: 5px">† nazrin > all things</span>
