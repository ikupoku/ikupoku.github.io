<!-- hi hi if youre seeing this that means youre using inspect element to look through my website! im honestly flattered but you should know that a LOT of the code here is not mine. the majority of the formatting here is taken from the ever so popular sadgrl's layout template which you can find at https://sadgrl.online/projects/layout-builder/, which i found from https://rafaelpro3728dos.neocities.org. highly recommend both of them, check them out they are both way more talented than i. with that have fun lookin at this lol-->
